# QT_examples
This repository contains several examples and experiments in C++ by using the <A href="http://qt.digia.com">QT Library</A>. These examples are verified by exploiting the <A href="http://qt.digia.com">QT Library 5.6 (Community Edition)</A>.<p>
<b>VERY IMPORTANT:</b><p>These examples are not guaranteed to be compiled and to work with other versions of the <A href="http://qt.digia.com">QT Library</A>, earlier than 5.6. Advanced and recent features are exploited.
