This repository contains several examples and experiments in C++ by using the <A href="http://www.qt.io">QT Library</A>. These examples are verified by exploiting the <A href="http://www.qt.io">QT Library 5.7 (Community Edition)</A>.<p>
<b><u>VERY IMPORTANT:</u></b><p>These examples are not guaranteed to be compiled and to work with other versions of the <A href="http://www.qt.io">QT Library</A>, earlier than version 5.7. Advanced and recent features are exploited. I am not interested in making these examples compatible with earlier versions. I want to experiment with advanced features in the last and stable version (September 2016) of this interesting and powerful library.
